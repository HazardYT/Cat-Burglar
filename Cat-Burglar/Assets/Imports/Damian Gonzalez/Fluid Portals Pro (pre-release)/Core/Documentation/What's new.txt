CHANGES TO 2.0: (November 26, 2020)

- Recursive rendering: Now you can face portals to each other and create infinite loops (similar to facing two mirrors and seeing yourself multiple times)

- Double-sided portals: A prefab of double-sided portals are included, which can be crossed from both directions

- Portals now have both thin and thick structures from which you can choose

- Optimization: Now you can choose to turn off unused or distant cameras. So, if you're not looking at a portal, or it's very far, it won't render

- Own Raycast system: Now you can call PortalRaycast.Raycast() instead of Physics.Raycast(), which will "teleport" your raycast if it hits a portal, returning the final hit information but also each segment, in case you want to draw the whole trace. Supports recursive rendering.

- Near clipping solved: In previous versions you could experiment, in narrow places or when portals are rotated from each other, some diagonal clipping issues. This is solved in version 2.0, aligning the near clipping of frustrums to the portals

- Much more seamless: Teleporting has been improved a lot, now you can cross forward, backwards and (the nightmare of portals) sideways, in one-sided, two-sided and recursive portals, thin and thicks structures, without a single flickering frame

- FPS controllers included: Now both a simple controller with rigidbody and a simple controller with "character controller" are included, both with habilities of shooting bullets and balls, and recieving bullets (your own bullets through portals!)

- More support for external FPS controllers: Now the portals itself (without intervention) can solve some common cases. And, as always, if your controller refuses to teleport, contact me and I'll give you a solution, as I did many times.

CHANGES TO 1.3: (April 22, 2020)

- Clones: Now it supports objects below the portal (between portals), using clones

- Full support for non-rigidbodies players (velocity is not longer used for calculations)

- Filters, so you can specify which objects can cross, and which ones cannot cross. Useful for childs of the player, like a gun.

- No more "direction checkers", now direction check is done entirely with calculations

- Reduction of the ugly effect when you cross looking at the sides of the arch

CHANGES TO 1.2: (April 17, 2020)

- Added my own first person controller. It's simple but effective and 100% compatible with this asset. Now demo scene is 100% playable, no need to add a 3rd party controller.

- Improvements on teleporting script.

- Portals of the set had slightly different configuration from each other, causing not teleporting when going backwards through a portal immediatly after teleporting forwards.

- Corrected: File 'portalEventsListenerExample.cs' was misplaced in 1.1, now is correctly inside /Scripts folder.

CHANGES TO 1.1:

- Reaction to resizes: Now when game window resizes, it automatically updates all render textures

- Better teleporting for "skewed" portals: Now when two portals has different rotations (for example, one facing north and other facing west, or one in the wall and the other in the roof), when something teleports, it also "rotates" its velocity, and changes in position are also calclulated considering the rotations.

- Events implementation: Now it fires events you can listen:
  a) when something teleports
  b) when portal setup is ready
  c) when game window resizes

- No more flickering bug: Fixed the bug of flickering for one frame, specially crossing it backwards. Now crossing the portal forewards or backwards, slow or fast, doesn't flicker anymore.

- Fallback for portals without rigidbody, or with rigidbody without velocity.

- Documentation is more extensive, and a link to on-line documentation has been provided (http://www.pipasjourney.com/damianGonzalez/portals/).
